/**
 * Background face-detection worker pool (#1074).
 *
 * Deliberately a near-copy of backgroundProcessor.js rather than a shared
 * abstraction: the two differ in exactly one behaviour (below), and inventing
 * a generic queue framework to save forty lines would make both harder to
 * read. Claim semantics, the janitor and the tunable shape are identical, so
 * anyone who understands one understands the other.
 *
 * THE ONE DIFFERENCE — a sidecar that is unreachable puts the photo back to
 * 'pending' with backoff, never 'failed'. Turning the ML container off for a
 * week must not require a manual re-scan afterwards. Only a 4xx (a genuinely
 * unprocessable image) marks a row failed.
 *
 * Nothing here starts unless the `faces` feature flag is on. That matters
 * more than usual because FACE_ML_URL now has a working default, so "is the
 * variable set" is no longer a signal — without the flag check, every install
 * would poll a hostname that does not resolve.
 *
 * Tunables (env, all optional):
 *   FACE_PROCESSOR_CONCURRENCY        default 1. Face scanning shares a host
 *                                     with Sharp; 1 is the safe default on
 *                                     the 2GB VPS class this project supports.
 *   FACE_PROCESSOR_POLL_MS            default 2000
 *   FACE_PROCESSOR_STUCK_TIMEOUT_MS   default 600000 (10 minutes)
 *   FACE_PROCESSOR_DISABLED           default false ('true' to opt out, e.g. CI)
