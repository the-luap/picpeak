/**
 * Shared run state for the photo maintenance sweeps (#1181).
 *
 * These jobs used to keep `{ isRunning, lastResult }` in a module-level
 * variable. That is invisible to every other replica, so on a multi-replica
 * install the status endpoint answers from whichever process the poll happens
 * to reach and a second POST can start a duplicate pass over the whole
 * library. Moving the state into the database makes both the claim and the
 * reporting shared.
 *
 * The claim is a conditional UPDATE whose affected-row count is the answer —
 * the same shape backgroundProcessor uses to hand a photo to exactly one
 * worker (backgroundProcessor.js:110-116). Two replicas issuing it
 * concurrently cannot both match: the row is locked for the duration of each
 * UPDATE, so the loser sees is_running already true and gets 0 rows back.
 *
 * A lease that can be taken over needs fencing, which is what claim_token is
 * for. Taking over a stale claim does not stop the old runner — it is a
 * process nobody can signal, quite possibly still walking the library. So
 * every write it attempts carries the token it was issued:
 *
 *   - heartbeat() reports whether the renewal landed. It returns false once
 *     the claim has moved on, and the run loops treat that as "stop".
 *   - release() only clears the row if the token still matches, so a
 *     superseded runner finishing late cannot clear the new owner's flag or
 *     overwrite its result.
 *
 * Without both of those, a takeover produces two live runners and the loser
 * ends up stomping the winner's state on its way out.
 *
 * Timestamps are written as ISO strings rather than Date objects. Production
 * stores Dates fine, but inside jest the sqlite3 binding turns them into the
 * literal string "[object Object]" (see CLAUDE.md), which would silently break
 * every staleness comparison in the tests. ISO-8601 also compares correctly
 * under SQLite's lexicographic text ordering, so the `<` below means the same
 * thing on both engines.
