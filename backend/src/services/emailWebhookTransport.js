/**
 * Webhook email transport (#1225).
 *
 * An alternative to SMTP: when EMAIL_WEBHOOK_URL is set, PicPeak POSTs the
 * composed message to that URL instead of sending it, and something downstream
 * (n8n, Make, a self-hosted relay) does the delivery.
 *
 * SMTP is the single most common thing people get stuck on in a self-hosted
 * install — app passwords, 587 vs 465, providers that reject the sender, NAS
 * boxes with no outbound 25. A webhook hands that problem to something the
 * operator usually already runs.
 *
 * Configured by environment, NOT in the admin UI. That is deliberate: this
 * setting redirects every outbound message, including password resets, so it
 * should not be changeable by a compromised admin session. It also matches how
 * the deploy that asked for this runs.
 *
 * Deliberately reuses the outbound-webhook primitives rather than growing a
 * second set: the same HMAC scheme (signPayload / X-PicPeak-Signature) so a
 * receiver verifies these exactly as it verifies gallery webhooks, and the same
 * DNS-resolving SSRF preflight.
