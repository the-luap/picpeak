 * Import the files under an external-media folder into an event.

 * the Import button runs — same walk, same dedupe, same insert, same
 * thumbnail and face handling — without going through HTTP.
 *
 * Mutual exclusion is the database claim from maintenanceJobState, keyed per
 * event. It replaces the in-process Set the route used to keep (#1162): that
 * Set stopped a double-click in ONE process, but a watcher on a second
 * replica, or an admin clicking Import while the watcher is mid-run on
 * another, would still walk the same tree twice. The unique index from
 * migration 186 keeps that from duplicating rows; the claim keeps it from
 * wasting the walk. The run heartbeats as it goes so a claim from a process
 * that died is taken over rather than held forever.
