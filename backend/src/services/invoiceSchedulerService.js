/**
 * invoiceSchedulerService — cron worker for CRM automation.
 *
 * Despite the name, this scheduler now drives THREE jobs:
 *   1. Flush invoices whose `scheduled_send_at` has passed and status
 *      is still 'scheduled' — flips them to 'sent' and queues the email.
 *   2. Run the overdue reminder ladder (first reminder at due_date +
 *      reminder_first_days, second at +second_days w/ late fee).
 *   3. Pre-event customer reminders (migration 143) — sends a nudge
 *      N days before `event_date`. Idempotent via
 *      `events.event_reminder_sent_at`.
 *
 * Jobs 1+2 delegate to `invoiceService.runScheduledTasks()`; job 3
 * to `eventReminderService.runEventReminderPass()`. The two service
 * calls run sequentially inside the same tick but in independent
 * try/catch blocks so a failure in one doesn't suppress the other.
 *
 * Wired in server.js boot path next to expirationChecker — see that
 * module for the cron pattern. Runs hourly; the per-row guards inside
 * each service prevent duplicate sends.
 *
 * The module name is kept as `invoiceSchedulerService` for backward
 * compatibility with the existing server.js import; rename to
 * `crmSchedulerService` is a future cleanup.
