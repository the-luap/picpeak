# Product-usage coverage: usage.v4

Reviewed PicPeak baseline: a5ff9264 (3.124.1-beta.0), plus the usage integration.
The inventory covers 81 backend route families (80 product families plus usage),
all 26 feature flags and all current settings tabs. This is capability coverage,
not instrumentation of every UI field. Source of truth: `usage-coverage.v4.json`.
The prior v2/v3 inventories and all v1/v2/v3 wire catalogs/schemas remain unchanged.

## Data scope

There are 86 capabilities: the original 19 in v1, 54 added in v2, and 13 added in
v3. v4 replaces `gallery_downloads` with `gallery_downloads_restricted`; the active
catalog remains at 86. 63 have configured/used booleans; 23 are configuration-only
and omit `used`. Historical views retain both questions separately (87 total keys).
ML face recognition was already included: only effective availability and a
successful authenticated admin capability operation, never biometric results.

v3 and v4 report exactly two installation-wide integers under `inventory`:
current gallery records and non-video photo records. Counts include drafts and
retained archive records. They are not uploads, unique files or processing-success
counts. No grouping by gallery, customer, user, content, media format or source.
No extra entity rows are fetched: inventory is computed using database counts.
Each count is a nonnegative integer at most 1,000,000,000; invalid/out-of-range
counts fail rather than being silently rounded or truncated.

No identities, business values, documents, image contents, messages, IPs, domains,
URLs, filenames, secrets, biometric results, per-action timestamps or frequencies.
A stable reporter fingerprint and feature/count combinations remain pseudonymous,
not anonymous. Existing access controls and opt-out deletion apply to all fields.

`configured` means technical availability or configuration, not evidence of use.
`used` is one monotonic bit since confirmed consent to the reporting schema. It
means successful authenticated admin capability operation, not necessarily final
completion of a queued job. New operation-specific bits use trusted success
signals in their handlers; failed operations and no-op conversions do not count.
Configuration-only signals never observe visitor/customer activity. Total photo
records can include guest uploads without observing individual upload actions.

## Consent and version transition

- v1/v2/v3 retain their exact sender and receiver contracts. Updating code does
  not grant consent to v4 or start collecting the restricted-downloads signal.
- v4 asks whether at least one gallery has downloads disabled, instead of the
  v2/v3 question whether at least one gallery allows them. These questions are
  not complements: mixed galleries can make both true. Never invert old values.
- The EN/DE dialog explains the change and all 86 capabilities plus both totals.
  An unchecked checkbox requires explicit `usage-consent.v4` consent.
- Prior queued packets finish unchanged: preserve packet ID, sequence, payload,
  logical day and digest. Only issue time, nonce and signature change on retry.
  Never rebuild an existing packet with a new snapshot under its old packet ID.
- Signed v4 consent can upgrade v1/v2/v3 without changing identity or history.
  Only the matching accepted receipt changes local scope and resets local markers.
  Lost receipts remain retryable; opt-out always wins over a late response.
- Collector first, client second. v1/v2/v3 remain accepted even after v4 consent.
  Missing fields stay unknown. Historical aggregation uses the union of known
  questions, while the active v4 sender still has exactly 86 fields.
