/**
 * Folder watcher for reference-mode events (issue 1187).
 *
 * Managed uploads dropped into storage/events/active are imported by
 * fileWatcher.js without anyone touching the admin UI. External media had no
 * equivalent: a reference event's NAS folder keeps growing, and every new
 * batch waits for someone to open the event and press Import. This service
 * runs that same import pass — literally the same function the button calls —
 * whenever a watched folder changes, and again on a timer.
 *
 * Shape, and why:
 *
 *   - Per-event opt-in (`events.external_watch`, migration 208), not a global
 *     switch. Each watched tree is a set of inotify handles or, on a mount
 *     that does not deliver events, a polling stat of every file in it. An
 *     install with hundreds of reference events should only pay that for the
 *     ones still receiving files.
 *
 *   - Change events trigger a debounced full pass over the folder, not a
 *     per-file insert. The import already skips rows it has, so a full pass
 *     costs one directory walk plus work for the new files — and it keeps
 *     exactly one code path for external ingest, with the dedupe, the type
 *     inference, the thumbnail and the face enqueue all in one place.
 *
 *   - A periodic sweep is the fallback, not an optimisation. NFS and SMB
 *     mounts routinely deliver no inotify events at all for writes made from
 *     another host, which for a NAS is the normal case. Without the sweep a
 *     watcher on such a mount would look configured and silently do nothing.
 *     EXTERNAL_MEDIA_WATCH_POLLING=true switches chokidar to stat-polling for
 *     installs that want change-driven imports on those mounts anyway.
 *
 *   - Deletions are ignored, deliberately. The manual import only ever adds.
 *     A file vanishing from the NAS is at least as likely to be a folder
 *     being reorganised, a mount dropping out, or a copy in progress as it is
 *     an intentional removal — and acting on it would delete a guest-visible
 *     photo. Rows whose file is gone stay, exactly as they do today.
 *
 *   - Every replica watches. Which one actually imports is settled by the
 *     per-event claim inside importExternalFolder; the others get
 *     ImportInProgressError and stand down. That is what makes the same code
 *     correct for the AIO container, a two-container install, and a
 *     multi-replica deploy behind a load balancer.
 *
 *   - Not gated on STORAGE_BACKEND. Unlike the managed watcher,
 *     EXTERNAL_MEDIA_ROOT is always a local filesystem path — reference
 *     galleries are not migrated to S3 — so an S3 install can watch too.
 *
 * Reconciliation runs on a timer against the events table rather than being
 * signalled by the toggle endpoint: the endpoint may execute on a different
 * replica than the one holding the watcher, and a minute of latency on a
 * checkbox is a better trade than cross-process signalling.
