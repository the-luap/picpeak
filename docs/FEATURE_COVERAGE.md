# Product-usage coverage: usage.v5

## What the numbers mean

The 86 v4 capabilities have all been reviewed for the distinction between
availability, a present configuration, and observed use. v5 asks 87 questions:
six broad admin-management questions are replaced by precisely defined edit
signals, and one question measures real template-mail transport acceptance.
There are 64 configured/used pairs and 23 configuration-only signals.
Historical views retain all 94 keys separately. No old value is renamed,
backfilled, reinterpreted, or combined with its replacement.

- **Built in** is availability, never an adoption percentage. This applies to
  gallery/media management, export/maintenance/archive/share/short-link tools,
  restore/import, moderation, guest administration, XMP, replacement and marks,
  as well as the built-in editors. An operation remains the evidence of use.
- **Enabled / configuration present** can be the shipped default, an inherited
  value or an explicit choice. Flags and configuration-only signals do not
  establish deliberate setup, successful delivery, or visitor activity.
- **Observed since consent** is one monotonic boolean. It is not frequency,
  recent activity, the present configuration, or proof of a job's completion.
  Existing operation signals keep their documented boundaries (including
  explicit connection tests, accepted jobs and admin calendar/analytics reads).
- The six new edit signals compare accepted, persisted product values. Empty
  requests, timestamps, previews, unchanged saves and automatically seeded
  records do not establish editing. Restoring a different default does count
  as an edit. Missing setting baselines are conservatively not inferred.
- CMS editing means a real internal title/body change. Changing only a logo or
  external link does not establish internal content editing; no page-view
  hooks are added. Earlier customization is not inferred from row existence,
  creation/update timestamps, activity logs or current private contents.
- Template editing and template sending are independent. An unchanged shipped
  template can be sent. Sending means SMTP accepted at least one recipient or
  the configured mail webhook accepted the real message. Preview, test, raw
  composer and newsletter messages do not set this bit. It includes queued
  and background template mail, but proves neither receipt nor reading.

A false edit/use bit means no qualifying observation since accepted consent;
it must never be presented as proof of unchanged defaults or lifetime non-use.
Old reporters' missing new questions are unknown, not false.

## Privacy and consent

New observations contain only fixed allowlisted booleans. The existing two
installation inventory totals (galleries and non-video photo records) are
unchanged. No content, recipient, template name/key, category/event identifiers,
logo, business value, per-action count, timestamp or content hash is stored in
usage markers or transmitted. Comparisons take place locally in the existing
admin operation; no content is scanned to reconstruct past usage.

Reports retain the existing stable installation fingerprint, PicPeak version,
daily date/generation time and gallery-layout enum. They are pseudonymous,
not fully anonymous. Existing retention, access controls and deletion apply.

Every v1–v4 wire schema/catalog remains immutable. New evidence is retained only
under active, confirmed usage-consent.v5. The signed consent upgrade preserves
identity and raw history, finishes pending old packets unchanged and resets
markers only after the matching receipt. Opt-out wins over late receipts.
A marker write failure must not retry a successfully sent email.
Deploy the collector before the PicPeak client; existing clients keep working.

## Full audit

The table is the decision for every active v5 capability. The route/flag/settings
inventory is `usage-coverage.v5.json`; historical inventories remain unchanged.
Exact definitions are served at `/schema/features.v5.json` and disclosed in the
PicPeak EN/DE consent catalog. A retired broad management signal remains under
its original definition in the collector's earlier-measurements view/history.
