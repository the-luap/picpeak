/**
 * Custom-resolution download jobs (#858).
 *
 * The plain download-all is served from the pre-built cache, which is built at
 * the gallery's STANDARD resolution. When a guest picks a different size there
 * is nothing to cache against — so instead of holding an HTTP connection open
 * while sharp chews through a whole gallery (a reverse proxy would time it out
 * long before it finished), the archive is built as a job:
 *
 *   POST .../download-jobs   → { token, status: 'pending' }
 *   GET  .../download-jobs/:token        → poll { status, progress }
 *   GET  .../download-jobs/:token/file   → the finished zip
 *
 * State lives in the `download_jobs` table rather than in memory: an in-memory
 * map loses every "ready" job on restart and is simply wrong the moment the
 * backend runs more than one replica.
 *
 * Artifacts land in the same `.download-cache` directory as the pre-built zip.
 * That directory is a dotfile, and s3AutoImporter skips dotfiles, so job zips
 * can never be mistaken for gallery photos and re-imported.
