Designed specifically for photographers and event organizers, PicPeak makes it simple to share beautiful, time-limited photo galleries with clients while maintaining full control over your data and branding.

## 🚀 Quick Start

Get PicPeak running in under 5 minutes:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/the-luap/picpeak.git
cd picpeak

# Copy environment template
cp .env.example .env

# Edit configuration (required: JWT_SECRET)
nano .env

# Start with Docker Compose
docker compose up -d

# Access at http://localhost:3005
```

Note on Docker file permissions (PUID/PGID)
- When using bind mounts (e.g., `./storage`, `./data`, `./logs`, `./events`), ensure the container user can write to these host folders. The backend runs as a non‑root user by default.
- Set `PUID` and `PGID` in your `.env` to match your host user’s UID/GID (run `id -u` and `id -g` on the host). Compose maps the container user to these values.
- Example in `.env`:
  - `PUID=1000`
  - `PGID=1000`
- Without this, creating events, uploads, thumbnails, or logs can fail with "Permission denied".

## 🔄 Release Channels

PicPeak offers two release channels for different needs:

### Stable Channel (Recommended)
- Production-ready releases
- Thoroughly tested before release
- Docker tags: `stable`, `latest`, or specific version like `v2.3.0`

### Beta Channel
- Early access to new features
- May contain bugs or incomplete functionality
- Docker tags: `beta` or specific version like `v2.3.0-beta.1`

### Switching Channels

Set the `PICPEAK_CHANNEL` environment variable in your `.env` file:

```bash
# For stable releases (default)
PICPEAK_CHANNEL=stable

# For beta releases
PICPEAK_CHANNEL=beta

# For a specific version
PICPEAK_CHANNEL=v2.3.0
```

Then update your containers:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.production.yml pull
docker compose -f docker-compose.production.yml up -d
```

### Update Notifications

The admin dashboard automatically notifies you when updates are available for your channel. To disable update checks, set:

```bash
UPDATE_CHECK_ENABLED=false
```

## 🌐 Public Landing Page

Spotlight your studio with a customizable marketing page at `/`:

- Head to **Admin → CMS Pages** to enable the public landing page toggle.
- Edit the provided HTML template (rich sections, hero, testimonials) and optional CSS overrides.
- The preview renders in a sandboxed iframe so you can iterate safely before publishing.
- PicPeak sanitizes stored HTML and CSS server-side—scripts, iframes, and unsafe attributes are stripped automatically.
- Use **Reset to default** anytime to restore the bundled template.
- The backend caches the rendered landing page for 60 seconds by default; override with `PUBLIC_SITE_CACHE_TTL_MS` if you need a different TTL.
- When the landing page is disabled PicPeak continues to serve the admin SPA/login exactly as before.

## 🎯 Use Cases

Perfect for:
- 💒 **Wedding Photographers** - Share ceremony photos securely
- 🎂 **Event Photography** - Birthday parties, corporate events
- 📸 **Portrait Studios** - Client galleries with download limits
- 🏢 **Corporate Events** - Internal photo sharing with branding
- 🎓 **School Photography** - Secure parent access with expiration

## 🏗️ Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, SQLite/PostgreSQL
- **Frontend**: React, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion
- **Storage**: File-based with automatic archiving
- **Email**: SMTP with customizable templates
- **Analytics**: Privacy-focused with Umami integration

## 💻 System Requirements

### Minimum Requirements
- **CPU**: 2 CPU cores
- **RAM**: 2GB minimum
- **Storage**: 20GB minimum (plus photo storage needs)
- **OS**: Linux (Ubuntu 20.04+), macOS, or Windows with WSL2
- **Node.js**: v18.0.0 or higher
- **Database**: SQLite (included) or PostgreSQL 12+

### Docker Requirements (Recommended)
- **Docker**: v20.10.0+
- **Docker Compose**: v2.0.0+

### Video Support Requirements
When enabling video uploads, consider these additional resources:

| Resource | Recommendation | Notes |
|----------|----------------|-------|
| **RAM** | 4GB+ recommended | FFmpeg processing requires more memory |
| **Storage** | Plan for 10-100x more | Videos are significantly larger than images |
| **CPU** | Additional cores help | Video thumbnail extraction is CPU-intensive |
| **Bandwidth** | Higher throughput | Video streaming requires more bandwidth |

**Technical Notes:**
- FFmpeg is bundled via npm (`@ffmpeg-installer/ffmpeg`) - no system installation required
- Maximum upload size: **10GB per video file**
- Chunked upload support for files >100MB (resumable uploads)
- Supported formats: MP4, WebM, MOV, AVI
- Video thumbnails are automatically generated from the first few seconds

**For Nginx/Reverse Proxy:**
If using Nginx, increase the client max body size:
```nginx
client_max_body_size 10G;
proxy_read_timeout 3600;
proxy_send_timeout 3600;
```
